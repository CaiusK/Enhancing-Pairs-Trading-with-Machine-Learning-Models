##### KeyWords: statistical arbitrage, generalized pairs trading, factor model, machine learning, Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM), AdaBoost

### Description
1. This research project aimed at implementing machine learning models on pairs trading strategies to improve performance.
2. S&P 500 data from 2012 to 2022 are covered in this project (including delisted ones).
